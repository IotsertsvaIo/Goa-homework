        <h1>BATTLE OF DIDGORI</h1>
        <!--text-->
        <p>The Battle of Didgori was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Seljuk Empire<br>at the narrow place of Didgori, 40 km west of Tbilisi, on August 12, 1121. The large Muslim<br> army, under the command of Ilghazi, was unable to maneuver and suffered a devastating defeat<br> due to King David IV of Georgia's effective military tactics.The battle at Didgori was the <br>culmination of the entire Georgian-Seljuk wars and led to the Georgians' reconquest of Tbilisi in<br> 1122. Soon after that David moved the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi. The victory at Didgori <br>inaugurated the medieval Georgian Golden Age and is celebrated in The Georgian Chronicles. Modern <br>Georgians continue to remember the event as an annual August 12 festival known as Didgoroba.</p>
