        <h1>DAVID IV</h1>
            <!--information-->
        <p>David IV, also known as David IV the Builder, of the Bagrationi dynasty, was the 5th king of Georgia from 1089 <br>until his 
        death in 1125. Popularly considered to be the greatest and most successful Georgian ruler in history and an <br>
        original architect of the Georgian Golden Age, he succeeded in driving the Seljuk Turks out of the country, <br>
        winning the Battle of Didgori in 1121. His reforms of the army and administration<br> 
        enabled him to reunite the country and bring most of the lands of the Caucasus under Georgia's control.<br> 
        A friend of the Church and a notable promoter of Christian culture, he was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox <br>
        Church.
