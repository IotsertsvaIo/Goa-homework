                <h1>FILM</h1>
                
                <p>What is a film? A film, also called a movie or a motion picture, is a series of still 
                photographs on film projected onto a screen using light in rapid succession. The optical 
                phenomenon known as persistence of vision gives the illusion of actual, smooth, and  
                continuous movement.</p>

                <h2>WHAT HAPPENS DURING FILMING?</h2>
                
                <p>Perhaps some of them would ask why I made this site about movies, when there are so many other topics? We made this thread because we wanted people to know what the movie means and which company the movies are generally distributed to.
                    We all probably know how long it takes to make movies, why? This is not a complicated process.
                The actors stand for hours to get one or two shots properly, sometimes they starve, everyone is hungry: the film director, cameraman, etc. why? Perhaps many of you will think about their reputation, maybe partially, but the truth is that they show us a good result and a movie. Then we got comfortable and enjoyed the movie.</p>
